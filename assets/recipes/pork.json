Form it into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap and freeze in an airtight container or plastic bag.<br/>2. Pre-bake the crust for 5 minutes without toppings. Let it cool, wrap it tightly with plastic wrap and foil and freeze. To use, let it thaw, add toppings and bake according to the recipe.<br/>3. Freeze a fully assembled pizza before baking. You can make your own frozen pizzas by making this pizza dough, topping it with sauce and toppings and flash-freezing it on a baking sheet. One it's hardened, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and foil and freeze for up to 2 months. Let thaw and bake.","inLanguage":"en-US"},"inLanguage":"en-US"},{"@type":"Question","@id":"https://joyfoodsunshine.com/easy-homemade-pizza-dough/#faq-question-1628258218349","position":2,"url":"https://joyfoodsunshine.com/easy-homemade-pizza-dough/#faq-question-1628258218349","name":"Can I let the dough rise?","answerCount":1,"acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, for a thicker, fluffier dough let it rise for 15-30 minutes, or until doubled.","inLanguage":"en-US"},"inLanguage":"en-US"},{"@type":"Question","@id":"https://joyfoodsunshine.com/easy-homemade-pizza-dough/#faq-question-1628258280297","position":3,"url":"https://joyfoodsunshine.com/easy-homemade-pizza-dough/#faq-question-1628258280297","name":"Can I make this dough the night before?","answerCount":1,"acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, to make this dough the night before put it in a bowl, cover it tightly with plastic wrap and a damp towel and store it in the refrigerator.","inLanguage":"en-US"},"inLanguage":"en-US"},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Recipe","name":"Easy Homemade Pizza Dough","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Laura"},"description":"This Easy Homemade Pizza Dough recipe yields the best ever homemade pizza in 30 minutes from start to finish!
